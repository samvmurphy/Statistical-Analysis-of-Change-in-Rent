# Statistical-Analysis-of-Change-in-Rent

The goal of this project was to determine if migration of college educated people was predictive of change in rent prices in cities. It is widely known that the percent of a city with a college degree is correlated with rent prices but my project sought to see if there was a relationship in the _change_ of college educated people (year-to-year) and rent (year-to-year). 

Analysis was done on 438 cities, ranging from the years 2010 to 2019 (not every city had that entire range). 

The conclusion to the question posited above is at the end of the Jupyter Notebook.
