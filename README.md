# Statistical-Analysis-of-Change-in-Rent

The goal of this project was to determine if migration of college educated people was predictive of rent prices in cities. It is widely known that the percent of a city with a college degree is correlated with rent prices but my project sought to see if there was a relationship in the _change_ of college educated people (year-to-year) and rent (year-to-year).
